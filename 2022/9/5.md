## Learnings

- One of things I will be learning is robotics using Aurdino. So today I was researching where to buy a one and a good tutorial to start with because I feel like I am in a dark hole when it comes to hardware :)
- First of all, I fouund a starter kit on a good price and will be buying next few days
- The tutorial I chose is this - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYw-L-RibttcvK-WBZm8WLEP. Clicked on 2-3 videos, read the comments on them and it looks like the guy teaches really good. So I will start with it.
- Also I will start and the Crash Course Physics series because I am really bad at this subject. I also have Physics in school right now, so will see if this series will be more helpful than school lessons. Link - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN0ge7yDk_UA0ldZJdhwkoV
