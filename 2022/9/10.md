Yesterday I forgot to write and push a Tracking File. So in this Tracking File Idescribe what I did on 09.09.22. But actually today (10.09.22) I didn't do anything related to programming. **But I promise this is the first and the last day I am gonna miss.**

## Activities
- Bought an Arduino Starter Kit
- Started Lecture 0 from CS50 where I learned nothing because it's basic material
