# Daily-Tracking
Tracking my programming journey on a daily basis using Tracking Files that are being uploaded every day. This repository is organised into nested folders - year, month, day.

## What is Tracking File?
This is a .md file where I describe what I do related to programming on a specific date. Every file consists of one or more of the following categories:
- Activities - what things I did on that day
- Learnings - what I have learned on that day
- Projects - what progress I have made on the active projects on that day
- Changes - what changes I have made in terms of my environment, methodology, etc
